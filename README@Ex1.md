Task 1
Write a python code which will count the number of unique letters and their frequency. 
Test the code with the word ‘Anaconda’. (Note: Remove Case Sensitivity)
Input: Anaconda
Output 1: Number of Unique Letters = 5. 
Output 2: {a: 3, c: 1, d: 1, n: 2, o: 1}

Task 2
A student’s evaluation is done based on 4 components: Class_Test (10%), Mid_Term (20%), Project (30%) & End_Term (40%). 
Write a python code to generate a random score between 10 & 90 (use python library: random) and get the evaluation bifurcation (Round off to Nearest Integer).
Example
Input = 80 (marks)
Class_Test = 8 (marks)
Mid_Term = 16 (marks)
Project = 24 (marks)
End_Term = 32 (marks)

Task 3
Write a python code to display the letters occurring commonly in 2 words. 
Test the code with the words ‘Python’ & ‘Anaconda’. (Note: Remove Case Sensitivity)
Input 1: Python
Input 2: Anaconda
Output: [o, n]

Task 4
Write a python code to generate a random score between 0 & 100 (use python library: random). Print the following as output:
1.	The score
2.	‘Grade F’ : If the score is less than 40
3.	‘Grade C’ : If the score is between 40 & 59
4.	‘Grade B’ : If the score is between 60 & 84
5.	‘Grade A’ : If the score is between 85 & 100

Task 5
Write a python code to generate a random number between 1 & 99 (use python library: random). Print the following as output:
1.	The random number [say, 9]
2.	List of even numbers up to the random number [2, 4, 6, 8]
3.	List of odd numbers up to the random number [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
4.	List of prime numbers up to the random number [2, 3, 5, 7]

Task 6
Write a python code to generate a 4-digit random number between 1000 & 9999 (use python library: random). Print each digit with its place value.
Example 
Input: 4321
Output: {4: Thousands, 3: Hundreds, 2: Tens, 1: Ones}

Task 7
Write a python code to generate 5 random numbers between -9 & +9 (use python library: random). Print the list of 5 random numbers and their sum.

Task 8
Write a python code to calculate the number of Years, Months & Days, with respect to Today, given a Date.
Example
Input: 15-08-1947 or August 15, 1947
Output: {Years: 77, Months: 01, Days: 01} (As on Aug 16, 2023)

Task 9
Write a python code to generate a ‘diamond’ pattern.

Task 10
Write a python code to create a list of 10 random letters (say List A). Create a copy of List A (say List B). Shuffle both List A & B. Treat each element of List A (say a) as Source and the corresponding element of List B (say b) as Destination. It is assumed that a from list A is connected to b from List B. Map the network of all connected elements such that an inquiry of any element will show the connected paths to & from the element.
